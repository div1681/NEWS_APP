# NEWS_APP

This is a Flutter app that displays a list of news articles, with details page for individual articles, a search screen, a saved screen, and a profile page.

## Screenshots

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of news articles with an option to view the article details.
- **Detail Page**: Shows full article details with options to save or share the article.
- **Search Screen**: Allows users to search for articles using a basic text input field.
- **Saved Screen**: A placeholder for saved articles (currently empty).
- **Profile Screen**: Displays user profile information (currently hardcoded).

## JSON Note

I was not able to add/import the sample JSON file for the articles, so I have added my own text content in place of the data.
